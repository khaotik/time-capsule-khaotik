# time-capsule-khaotik
My personal time capsule.

It's encrypted with a strong algorithm, without a decryption key stored anywhere in the world.

GitHub repos are expected to last very long. This time capsule can only be opened by future technology, either some serious advancement in cryptanalysis techniques,
or newer computer architectures. Certain events, information and thoughts are simply problematic and/or dangerous to publish publically. They will be stored here, (hopefully) securely preserved.

It would interesting to reveal these secrets at some point in future, either a more enlightened age or a more dystopian one.
Contents can range anywhere from being stupid, hilarious, prophethetic, plain-factual, tear-squeezing, schizophrenic, existential-threatening, or lovecraftian-dreadful.

I just hope it doesn't get unlocked *too soon*.

## use cases

- Someone, or something, you love or hate he/she/it to the bones.

- You just murdered someone. It's such a great milestone in your life, but you can't let anyone know ... yet.

- You worked on a confidential government project. Think twice before you write them here. Are these encryption strong enough?

- Some journalism cannot be done in common manner.

- A great scientific discovery! Maybe you have a partial plan on how to accomplish that. Maybe you think everyone in the field is wrong and you are the correct one. You can't pass the peer review yet.

- You can't find a better way to show off your greatest bitcoin heist. Your technique is so profound and they deserve to be recorded in the archives.

- You would like to scam someone in the future, and thus you put some fake information here. You think you can outsmart them?

- Just facts. Facts are precious because entropy is constantly increasing in the universe.

## risk factors

- There's a chance the tech advances so fast and things get decrypted sooner than expected.

- There's a much smaller chance that these thing are never getting decrypted.

  -- The human civilization might just perish, well then.

  -- Somehow it's mathematically proven even with all energy in the observable universe and best algorithm, p of decryption is still negligible.

  -- Someone demolished all the github archives. Who would even do that? For what purpose?

### TODO design a tiny API for adding encrypted content

### TODO actually start adding content
